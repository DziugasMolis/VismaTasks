## Task 1

Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function that will return true if the ransom note can be construted from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string contain only lowercase letters.

## Note:

You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

canConstruct("a", "b") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false
canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> true


## Task 2

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

For example, given nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], after calling your function, nums should be [1, 3, 12, 0, 0].

## Note: 

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
